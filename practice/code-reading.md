# Code reading

## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    function f1()
3    {
4        let x = 2;
5        console.log(x);
6    }
7    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers.

Answer:
Line 1 = Scope global, Line 4 = Scope local (to function).

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1())
console.log(y)
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.

Answer:
10
Undefined
ReferenceError

10 because x is a global scope
Undefined because there isn't a return something
ReferenceError because y is a local scope and is printed outside

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
Answer:
9
{x: 10}

9 because x was declared outside (global scope)
{x:10} because was declared outside and 1 was added as local scope on y.x (y is a object)
